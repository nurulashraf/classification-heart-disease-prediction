# Heart Disease Prediction using Classification Models

This project predicts heart disease using three popular classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. It covers data loading, scaling, training, evaluation, and simple visualisations for understanding model performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used.
- `notebooks/`: Main Jupyter Notebook folder containing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Features

- Load and explore heart disease dataset
- Scale features for better model performance
- Train three models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluate models with:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualise:
  - Decision tree structure
  - ROC Curve and AUC
  - Confusion matrices
